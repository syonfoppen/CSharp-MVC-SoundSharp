# CSharp-MVC-SoundSharp
This was the first C# project were I was introduced to object oriented programming. 
For this project I first had to make a class library and later use this library to make a: console application, a WPF application and a MVC web application. 
This was also the first project were I learned to use a database using Microsoft SQL.
